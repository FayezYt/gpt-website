There a lot lot lot of glitched when i cancel order the blur in screen be 24/7. 2- The Arabic font is bullshit make it like comic sans but something in Arabic 3- you don't trasflate thing like add make it in Arabic you shouldn't change only the product name 4- When I press in nevbar products or about or contact it should remove the hover from the Home and put it in the one I press the re is a underline 5-  change the placeholders for a photos like logo etc... 6- the black theme have many error like the checkout text I can't see it and a lot lot lot more 7- the continue shopping button the text is so so so small and the arrow is so so so big fix it 8- detail change it to arabic if the user change the langeuge 9- when I press on add to cart it should give me a confirm 10- the dropbox is glitchy in Arabic bcz the arrow is inside a text idk why bcz the Arabic start from the right and the arrow is in the right. Make the style for stylish Bcz I rate this 7.5/10 we want more more and give a button in website ( we will delete it later but only for the debugging) that have a color hex and it will change the style to see which is the best color for our website and if you can make it in many files like CSS file HTML and js it will be better for me and you link them all in same file index.html , styles.css, main.js
